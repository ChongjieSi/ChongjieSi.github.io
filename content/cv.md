      title: '🎵 As a Musician'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        Beyond research, I am a passionate multi-instrumentalist, composer, and arranger 🎼. My primary instruments are the piano and the guitar, and I absolutely love using keyboards for composition and production 🎹. As a band musician, I play keyboard and guitar, occasionally stealing the spotlight as lead vocalist 🎤, bassist, or even drummer 🥁. I also play the cello 🎻, completely enchanted by its rich, melancholic timbre—a voice that whispers sorrow and longing with heartbreaking beauty 💔.

        I write and arrange my own music, obsessed with the magic of blending instruments into a symphony of emotions ✨. My go-to styles are pop-rock and R&B, and I’ve got tons of hands-on experience in vocal and instrumental recording 🎧. Back in the day, I led the Songyi Awakening Music Studio and rocked as president of Southeast University’s Guitar Society. One of my proudest moments? Composing the 2022 graduation song, which won the "National Outstanding Youth Works" award 🏆—and later, during my PhD, another original track was honored as a "Shanghai Outstanding Work" 🎶.

        Admittedly, academic demands keep me crazy busy these years, but I still sneak in solo sessions on piano, guitar, and cello, jamming and improvising like there’s no tomorrow 🎵🔥. And though time’s tight, I just can’t quit composing—because the music inside me? It’s practically bursting to break free 💥.

      title: '🎱 As a Snooker Enthusiast'
      subtitle: ''

        My love affair with snooker began in high school, and what started as a hobby has now spanned nearly a decade ⏳. At my peak, I proudly held the title of my university’s "top cueist" 🏅 and even notched a personal best break of 82 points—agonizingly close to that dream century! These days, thanks to the relentless demands of research, my game isn’t as sharp as it once was, but I still sneak in frames whenever possible. When short on time, I switch to Chinese 8-ball (and hey, I’ve got a university team championship 🏅 and individual third-place finish under my belt! 🥉).

        Beyond playing, I’m a hardcore fan. I’ve been fortunate beyond words to witness snooker gods like O’Sullivan, Higgins, Trump, Selby, and Ding Junhui work their magic live—heart-stopping moments I’ll never forget. Even more surreal? Getting to chat briefly with them and absorb priceless tips (Ronnie’s advice on cueing still echoes in my mind! 🎯).

        To me, snooker is equal parts art and algebra—geometry meets guts, where every shot is a high-wire act of calculation and nerve. And while academia keeps me busy, the green baize still calls my name... because once a snooker soul, always a snooker soul ❤️🎱.
