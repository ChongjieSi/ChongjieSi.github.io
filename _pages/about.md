Ph.D Student \\
Artificial Intelligence Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University

## Short Bio

Chongjie Si is a Ph.D Student at the Artificial Intelligence Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) advised by [Dr. Wei Shen <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i>](https://shenwei1231.github.io), since Sept. 2022. He previously obtained the Bachelorâ€™s degree from Chien-Shiung Wu College, Southeast University (SEU) in 2022.

## Research Interests
